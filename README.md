# Main Two types of Machine LEarning algorithms are Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Algorithm.

## - In supervised learning we are going to teach computer how to do something.
### - Supervised Learnigns are of two types - Regression and Classification
#### - This repository has files about classfication only.

- First Question that will coem to anyone's mind is what is Classfication.
- In a classification we are trying to predict result for a descrete output.Also we can say that here we are trying to map input varaibles to descrete categories.

# Classification-Supervised-Learning--Machine-Learning
How to find right threshold for Classfifcation is present in the file called "Selecting the right threshold value using ROC curve.pynb" file
