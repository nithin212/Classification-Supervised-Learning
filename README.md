# Main Two types of Machine LEarning algorithms are Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Algorithm.

## - In supervised learning we are going to teach computer how to do something.
### - Supervised Learnigns are of two types - Regression and Classification
#### - This repository has files about classfication only.

- First Question that will come to anyone's mind is what is Classfication.
- In a classification problem we try to predict the result for a descrete output.Also we can say that here we are trying to map input varaibles to descrete categories.
- Some of the classification algorithms are Logistic Regression, K-mean Classification, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc.

##### - List of files present in this Repository.
# Classification-Supervised-Learning--Machine-Learning
How to find right threshold for Classfifcation is present in the file called "Selecting the right threshold value using ROC curve.pynb" file
