# Main Two types of Machine LEarning algorithms are Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Algorithm.

## - In supervised learning we are going to teach computer how to do something.
### - Supervised Learnigns are of two types - Regression and Classification
####


# Classification-Supervised-Learning--Machine-Learning
How to find right threshold for Classfifcation is present in the file called "Selecting the right threshold value using ROC curve.pynb" file
